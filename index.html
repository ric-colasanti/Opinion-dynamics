      <h1>Opinion dynamics</h1>
      <h3>An agent based model in NetLogo</h3>
      <p>Rainer, Hegselmann, and Ulrich Krause. "Opinion dynamics and bounded confidence: models, analysis and simulation." (2002).</p>
    </div>
   <div class="container">
   <h2>Overview:</h2>
   <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The model simulates the opinion dynamics of a group of persons with different levels of
      extremism and uncertainty.</p>
   <p><strong>Entities/Individuals:</strong> The individuals in the model are called &quot;persons&quot;, and they have
      two attributes: opinion and uncertainty.</p>
   <p><strong>Process/Mechanisms:</strong> The persons interact with each other through one of two opinion update rules:
      Deffuant or Edmonds. The opinion update rules consider the distance between the persons' opinions and their
      uncertainty levels.</p>
   <p><strong>Environment:</strong> The environment is a two-dimensional space with a fixed size and scale.</p>
   <p><strong>Simulation time:</strong> The simulation runs for a specified number of iterations.</p>
   <h2>Design concepts:</h2>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> The persons interact with each other through the opinion update rules, which
         consider the distance between their opinions and their uncertainty levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Stochasticity:</strong> The model includes randomness in the initial opinions and uncertainties of the
         persons, as well as in the choice of interaction partner.</li>
      <li><strong>Collectives:</strong> The collective behavior of the persons emerges from their individual
         interactions and opinions.</li>
      <li><strong>Observation:</strong> The model tracks the opinions and uncertainties of the persons over time.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Details:</h2>
   <p><strong>Initialization:</strong> At the beginning of the simulation, the model creates a number of persons with
      initial opinions and uncertainties. The persons are distributed in the environment according to their opinions.
   </p>
   <p><strong>Input:</strong> The user can specify the number of persons, the number of iterations, the initial moderate
      and extremist uncertainties, and the opinion update rule (Deffuant or Edmonds).</p>
   <h3>Submodels:</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>The <code>setup</code> procedure initializes the environment and the persons.</li>
      <li>The <code>scale-opinion</code> reporter calculates the y-coordinate of a person based on its opinion.</li>
      <li>The <code>go</code> procedure runs the simulation for a specified number of iterations.</li>
      <li>The <code>update</code> procedure updates the opinion and uncertainty of a person based on the chosen opinion
         update rule.</li>
      <li>The <code>average</code> procedure calculates the average opinion of a person and its interaction partner.
      </li>
      <li>The <code>g</code> and <code>f</code> reporters calculate the interaction strength between two persons based
         on their uncertainty levels and the opinion distance.</li>
      <li>The <code>deffuant</code> and <code>edmonds</code> procedures implement the Deffuant and Edmonds opinion
         update rules, respectively.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Output:</h2>
   <p>The model outputs the opinions and uncertainties of the persons over time. The user can visualize the simulation
      and observe the emergent behavior of the collective.</p>
